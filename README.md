# Advent of Code 2020
This year I chose to do advent of code in python.

I'm currently wanting to master basic development in Python as a way to 
1. broaden my web development capabilities.
2. have a go to language for lower level operations that is well established.
3. build up to data engineering and machine learning skills.
